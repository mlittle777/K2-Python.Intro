    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with numbers is central to almost all scientific and engineering computations. \n",
    "The topic is so important that there are many dedicated libraries to help implement efficient numerical\n",
    "computations. There are even languages that are specifically designed for numerical computation, such as Fortran\n",
    "and MATLAB.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (http://www.numpy.org/) is the most widely used Python library for numerical computations.  It provides an extensive range of data structures and functions for numerical\n",
    "computation. In this notebook we will explore just some of the functionality.\n",
    "You will be seeing NumPy in other courses. NumPy can perform many of the operations that you will learn\n",
    "during the mathematics courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another library, which largely builds on NumPy and provides additional functionality, is SciPy (https://www.scipy.org/). SciPy provides some  more specialised data structures and functions over NumPy. \n",
    "If you are familiar with MATLAB, NumPy and SciPy provide much of what is available in MATLAB.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a large and extensive library and this activity is just a very brief introduction.\n",
    "To discover how to perform operations with NumPy your best resources are search engines, such as http://stackoverflow.com/.\n",

    "- Manipulating arrays (indexing, slicing, etc)\n",

Python lists are very flexible and can hold mixed data types, e.g. combinations op floats and strings, or even lists of lists of lists . . .\n",

Many science, engineering and mathematics problems involve very large problems with operations on numbers, and computational speed is important for large problems. To serve this need, we normally use specialised functions and data structures for numerical computation, and in particular for arrays of numbers. Some of the flexibility of lists is traded for performance."
